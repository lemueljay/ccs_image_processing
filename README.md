## ðŸ“· Webcam Capture Note
To capture live images from a webcam, Device.cs and DeviceManager.cs are required. However, these components only support VFW (Video for Windows), which is not compatible with my webcam.

As a result, Iâ€™ve opted to use the Emgu CV library instead, which leverages DirectShow or Media Foundationâ€”both of which offer broader support for modern webcams.

## ðŸ”§ Future Support Suggestion:
It would be beneficial to update or extend Device.cs and DeviceManager.cs to support DirectShow, enabling compatibility with a wider range of webcam devices.
